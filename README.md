# [rashee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rashee)

Get your horoscope for the day printed to your console!

Add it to your CI/CD pipeline, run it for fun sometimes, or make it your opening command every time you open your terminal. Do whatever you want with it!

This app uses the excellent [aztro](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro) API.

## Installation

First, clone the repository locally using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rmorabia/rashee.git
```

Then, navigate to the repository using:

```sh
cd rashee
```

Lastly, install the necessary Node modules using:

```sh
npm i
```

## Usage

**Note:** The `<sunsign>` command refers to the most prominent and common sign you associate with horoscopes. It's what comes up on Google when you type in your birthday + "zodiac sign." 

The best way to use this app is to run:

```
npx rashee <sunsign>
```

You can also install it using:

```
npm i (-g) rashee
```

If you have it installed, you can run it by using:

```
rashee <sunsign>
```
